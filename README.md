About to reboot this project in a major way. Big things coming soon.

Check the site or follow on [Mastodon](https://fosstodon.org/@ftprivacy), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ftprivacy), or [Telegram](https://t.me/FTPrivacy) for updates on cool new stuff.

As I'm working on rebuilding a new site you can still use both the existing blocklists, all handily listed out [here](https://ftprivacy.cloud/domain-blocklists.html), and you can use the regex lists being added and updated in this repo by simply clicking on one, clicking "raw", then simply pasting the "raw" URL into an adblocker that supports regex or ad block rules. These include Pi Hole and AdGuard Home as well as pfSense and just about every single ad block browser extension in existence.

Much more info and tutorials coming very soon!
