# Regex whitelist of legit crypto miner pools for miners

# Many blocklists try to prevent "cryptojacking" malware from working by blanket blocking all miner pools.
# The problem? This also blocks mining pools for people who legitimately mine cryptocurrencies.
# Add this whitelist to AdGuard Home or any other blocker that accepts regex lists ("adblock rules") and never have to worry about this again!

# Added this list but your miners are still getting blocked from the pools?
# Feel free to make a PR adding your miner's domain using the GitHub repo link above.
# As long as the pool is serving legit users and takes steps to prevent abuse by botnets it will be approved.

# Please note this list does NOT include mining pools used exclusively by botnets and only accepts pools that take steps to prevent abuse by botnets.
# Therefore it should not be used as a blocklist. It won't provide full protection against actual "cryptojacking" malware.
