# I made this to allow Messenger even if Facebook is blocked by another blocklist
# For my own use with AdGuard Home's "allow list" feature while Facebook is on in "blocked services"

# Want to use this as an allow list too? Awesome. However, please note that as fbcdn.net and similar domains would still be blocked by a full FB blocklist
# So images may not work but basic messaging functionality should.

# Can equally be used as a blocklist within AdGuard if you wish, although keep in mind you can use
# Filters > Blocked Services to block various social media services in an automated fashion
# However sometimes it is not granular enough, i.e. if you block Facebook it blocks Messenger, hence me creating this.

# So if you don't want to block FB but do want to block messenger or vice versa, this will do exactly that
# for any blocker that accepts regex adblock rules (won't work if it only takes plain lists of domains)
