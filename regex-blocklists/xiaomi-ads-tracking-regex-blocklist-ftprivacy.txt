# This is an "adblock style" regex blocklist for Xiaomi smartphones running the stock MIUI ROM.

# Xiaomi injects ads and trackers directly into its official MIUI Android ROMs that ship with the phones.
# This list tries to block as many as possible while leaving the base functionality of services Mi Cloud working.
# Crucially, it assures OTAs still work so you continue to get OS updates with security patches.

# Want a list that'll just totally block all Xiaomi/Mi/MIUI services (and still allow OTAs)?
# Add this one as well: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ftpmorph/ftprivacy/master/blocklists/xiaomi-ads-tracking.txt
# If you don't care about Xiaomi services I recommend adding both. If you do use those services, only add this one.
