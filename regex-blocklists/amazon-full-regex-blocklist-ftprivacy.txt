# Blocks Amazon Alexa and other services as well as blocking Amazon "telemetry" and ads
# Does not intentionally block Amazon's store webpage or app so you can still shop there
# It also does not block AWS services as these are used all over the internet
# Please report any entries that stop the main Amazon site or AWS from working so they can be fixed

# Note that the "smartphone and general" list blocks only the Amazon ads and tracking if that's all you want

# This is a regex based "adblock rules" list, compatible with AdGuard Home or PiHole v5 with a regex extension 
# AdGuard Home is what I use and I can confirm it is tested and working there
