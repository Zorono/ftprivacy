# Regex rule for all messenger.com domains, this will block access to the FB Messenger domain
# It can also be used to allow it if, for example, you have a blocklist covering all of FB but still need Messenger access

# I made this to allow Messenger even if Facebook is blocked by another blocklist
# For my own use with AdGuard Home's "allow list" feature

# Want to use this as an allow list too? Awesome. However, please note that as fbcdn.net and
# similar domains would still be blocked by a full FB blocklist, images may not work
# But basic messaging functionality should

# Can equally be used as a blocklist within AdGuard if you wish, although keep in mind you can use
# Filters > Blocked Services to block various social media services in an automated fashion
# However sometimes it is not granular enough, i.e. if you block Facebook it blocks Messenger, hence me creating this

# So if you don't want to block FB but do want to block messenger or vice versa, this will do exactly that
# for any blocker that accepts regex adblock rules (won't work if it only takes plain lists of domains)

# If you use AdBlock Home you can add regex blocklists the same as you add a list of domains blocklist
# If you use Pi Hole, although you can manually add regex rules in the web UI, it does not natively support regex lists at the time of writing
# You can just copy/paste this single rule to your whitelist in Pi Hole and it will work

# In the future I will be releasing more regex blocklists to allow for cleaner and more efficient adblocking
# These will work natively for AdGuard Home but for Pi Hole will require a Python script: https://github.com/mmotti/pihole-regex
